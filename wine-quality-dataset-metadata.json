The datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks. The classes are ordered and not balanced (e.g. there are much more normal wines than excellent or poor ones).Your task is to predict the quality of wine using the given data.\n\nA simple yet challenging project, to anticipate the quality of wine.\nThe complexity arises due to the fact that the dataset has fewer samples, \u0026 is highly imbalanced.\nCan you overcome these obstacles \u0026 build a good predictive model to classify them?\n\n**This data frame contains the following columns:**\n\nInput variables (based on physicochemical tests):\\\n1 - fixed acidity\\\n2 - volatile acidity\\\n3 - citric acid\\\n4 - residual sugar\\\n5 - chlorides\\\n6 - free sulfur dioxide\\\n7 - total sulfur dioxide\\\n8 - density\\\n9 - pH\\\n10 - sulphates\\\n11 - alcohol\\\nOutput variable (based on sensory data):\\\n12 - quality (score between 0 and 10)\n\n### Acknowledgements:\nThis dataset is also available from Kaggle \u0026 UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine\u002Bquality.\n\n### Objective:\n- Understand the Dataset \u0026 cleanup (if required).\n- Build classification models to predict the wine quality.\n- Also fine-tune the hyperparameters \u0026 compare the evaluation metrics of various classification algorithms."}
